                        <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when
                        you visit or make a purchase from makethisquick.com (the “Site”).</p>

                        <h4>Personal information we collect</h4>
                        <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
                        including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies
                        that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information
                        about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred
                        you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
                        automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.</p>

                        <h4>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</h4>
                        <p> - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
                        anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,
                        visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
                        <p>- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
                        browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</p>
                        <p>- “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how
                        you browse the Site.

                        Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect
                        certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment
                        information (including credit card numbers, and potentially information in regards to other third party payment vendors such as cash app, zelle, venmo, paypal), email
                        address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”.

                        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about
                        Device Information and Order Information.</p>

                        <h4>How do we use your personal information?</h4>
                        <p>We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the
                        Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you
                        with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:</p>
                        <p>- Communicate with you;</p>
                            <p>- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and</p>
                                <p>- When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or
                        advertising relating to our products or services.</p>

                        particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example,
                        by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess
                        the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
